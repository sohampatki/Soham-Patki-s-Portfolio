 For this project, I used Python's Beautiful Soup package to scrape information about the the Top 500 most popular movie released between the years 2018-2020 [(source here)](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?at=0&sort=num_votes,desc&start=1&title_type=feature&year=2018,2020) on the IMDB.com platform (measured by the number of votes each movie recieved).

 1. Collecting information on 8 parameters: movie ID, title, rank, release year, movie
runtime, rating, number of votes, and genres.
2. Storing the information in a sturctured (.csv) format
3. Cleansing and transforming data using Alteryx to remove unwanted characters (leading and trailing whitespaces, characters, punctuation) from numerical variables
4. Changing datatypes to the correct format and joining the dataset with an existing dataset of older rankings using Alteryx.

## [Project 2: Hotel Reservations Relational Database Design Project](https://github.com/sohampatki/Portfolio/tree/main/Hotel%20Reservations%20Database%20Design)

As part of my master's Database Management coursework, I designed a relational database to store hotel reservations and implemented it using MySQL. The steps involved in this project were:

1. Determining the business value of hotels providing customers the option of making reservations directly with them instead of through a third party vendor like Expedia.
2. Defining the project's objective and identifying business requirements for the database to effectively capture relevant information, taking into account the complexities of managing room reservations at a large hotel. 
3. Establishing relevant entities, their attributes and the cardinalities of relationships between different entities.
4. Developing an ERD and Database Schema, ensuring it is normalized to 3NF.
5. Writing SQL code to implement the database using sample data for customers, hotel rooms, reservations, billing information etc.
6. Demonstrating how the database can support routine business operations and provide detailed analytical insights using SQL queries.

## [Project 3: Speciality Chocolate Competitor Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/sohampatki/Portfolio/tree/main/Competitive%20Analysis%20Dashboard%20(Tableau)%20)

To practice my data visualization skills, I developed a strategic dashboard aimed to support the business decision-making of a specialty chocolate brand. The dashboard was created with the aim of helping decision makers track the ratings of competing brands and each of their product offerings, the prices and quality of beans based on the country they are sourced from, and the frequency and average ratings of different formulations and cocoa percentages of chocolate bars. Steps involved in creating the dashboard were:

1. Identifying data sources for chocolate bar ratings, cocoa bean quality ratings by country and cocoa bean prices by country.
2. Using R to manipulate raw data and make joining them possible using common parameters.
3. Transforming variables to make interpretation and visual analysis more intuitive.
4. Creating a slide deck explaining different aspects of the dashboard and demonstrating examples of effective usage.

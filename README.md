## [Project 1: IMDB Top 500 Rated Movies Web Scraping Project](https://github.com/sohampatki/Portfolio/tree/main/WebScraping)

For this project, I used Python's Beautiful Soup package to scrape information about the the Top 500 most popular movie released between the years 2018-2020 [(source here)](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?at=0&sort=num_votes,desc&start=1&title_type=feature&year=2018,2020) on the IMDB.com platform (measured by the number of votes each movie recieved), after which I merged it with a pre-existing dataset of movies. The steps involved were:

1. Collecting information on 8 parameters: movie ID, title, rank, release year, movie
runtime, rating, number of votes, and genres.
2. Storing the information in a sturctured (.csv) format
3. Cleansing and transforming data using Alteryx to remove unwanted characters (leading and trailing whitespaces, characters, punctuation) from numerical variables
4. Changing datatypes to the correct format and joining the dataset with an existing dataset of older rankings using Alteryx.

## [Project 2: Hotel Reservations Relational Database Design Project](https://github.com/sohampatki/Portfolio/tree/main/Hotel%20Reservations%20Database%20Design)

As part of my master's Database Management coursework, I designed a relational database to store hotel reservations and implemented it using MySQL. The steps involved in this project were:

1. Determining the business value of hotels providing customers the option of making reservations directly with them instead of through a third party vendor like Expedia.
2. Defining the project's objective and identifying business requirements for the database to effectively capture relevant information, taking into account the complexities of managing room reservations at a large hotel. 
3. Establishing relevant entities, their attributes and the cardinalities of relationships between different entities.
4. Developing an ERD and Database Schema, ensuring it is normalized to 3NF.
5. Writing SQL code to implement the database using sample data for customers, hotel rooms, reservations, billing information etc.
6. Demonstrating how the database can support routine business operations and provide detailed analytical insights using SQL queries.
